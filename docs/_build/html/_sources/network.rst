Network Module
===============

The ``network`` module provides tools for **modeling optical network topologies**,
loading them from different file formats, and preparing the data for
**planning and simulation** in the SixDman toolkit.

Module Overview
----------------

This module is responsible for:

- Representing an optical network topology using **NetworkX graphs**.
- Loading adjacency matrices from ``.mat``, ``.npz``, or ``.npy`` files.
- Set the hierarchy level of different nodes in the network.
- Compute k-shortest paths between source and destination nodes using Yen's algorithm.
- Identify link- and node-disjoint path pairs (LAND pairs) for each source node. 

Key Classes
------------

- **Network**

    .. autoclass:: sixdman.core.network.Network
        :members:
        :special-members: __init__
        :undoc-members:
        :show-inheritance: 


Key Methods
------------

- **``__init__(topology_name)``**  
  Initializes the network with a given name and hierarchical structure.

- **``load_topology(filepath, matrixName=None)``**  
  Loads the adjacency matrix from a file and converts it to a NetworkX graph.  
  Supports **.mat**, **.npz**, and **.npy** formats.

- **``define_hierarchy(filepath, matrixName=None)``**  
  Set the hierarchical levels of nodes in the network.

- **``compute_k_shortest_paths(subnet_matrix, paths, source, target, k=20)``**  
  Compute k-shortest paths between source and target nodes using Yenâ€™s algorithm.

- **``land_pair_finder(src_list, candidate_paths_sorted, num_pairs)``**  
  Identify link- and node-disjoint path pairs (LAND pairs) for each source node.

Notes
------

- Ensure that the file path is correct and accessible.
- ``matrixName`` is mandatory for ``.mat`` files.
- The adjacency matrix is stored in **upper-triangular form** to avoid duplicate edges.

- ``Network`` is the **foundation for the planning and simulation modules**,
  so it should be instantiated and populated before using any planning methods.
