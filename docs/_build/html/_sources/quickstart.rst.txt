Quick Start
============

After installation, you can quickly get started with **network planning and simulation** in SixDman.

----

1️⃣ Launch Example Jupyter Notebooks
-------------------------------------

Navigate to the **examples/** directory and start Jupyter:

.. code-block:: bash

   jupyter notebook examples/

You will find examples such as:

- **MAN157_Singel_Level.ipynb** – Basic single-level network planning  
- **MAN157_Total_Level_50G.ipynb** – Multi-level hierarchical network simulation

Open a notebook and **run all cells** to see a full demo of:

- Network topology modeling
- Multi-band (C/L/S) traffic planning
- Route and wavelength assignment (RWA)
- KPI visualization

----

2️⃣ Running Unit Tests
-----------------------

Ensure everything works correctly:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest -v

All tests should pass before starting your experiments.
